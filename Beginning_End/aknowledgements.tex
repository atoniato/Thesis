\chapter*{Aknowledgements}

I would like to thank all the people I met in CP$^3$ during the years of my PhD. In particular, I thank Francesco Sannino and Claudio Pica for supervising me during my studies, and for involving me in very interesting research. I thank all the members of the lattice group for always being available to help, and in particular I thank Tadeusz Janowski from whom I learned very many things. During these three years, I shared office with many people, and I thank them all for the good time spent together. Among them, Anders Eller Thomsen is the most longstanding officemate, and he deserves a special thanks for all the good conversations and for always being available to help. I thank Kari Rummukainen and Kimmo Tuominen for hosting me at the university of Helsinki, where I spent a very good and fruitful time during my environmental change. Finally, I thank my family for their immense support.
